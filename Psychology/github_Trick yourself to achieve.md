So you should know that in psychology (yes of course it's Encoding, Storage and Retrieval) the memory is just like ram (yes technically is the hippocampus since is the short-term), it's good when you use it but, when you turn off and turn on next day it's reset. Memory is association for human, but for computers is just binary.
Brain should create and have ideas not to store ideas, you should use computer or smartphone or whatever to store your ideas or your actions or whatever.
So tldr:
1. Don't trust your memory, trust what you saved what you written previous day.

Use your phone if you have a thought, a bad or good one doesn't matter, use iphone record or a notebook or whatever is good for you.
Write things thoughts everything you can and re-elaborate it later so you have an historic of your action and thoughts both

I know is stupid but you have to start to use calendar or google calendar or whatever works for you. It's ok to forget events like bdays or going out with your friend or whatever. Separate calendar from task management, task are not events, task are activities with deadline for example "send x email to professor before z date". you can use google task or iphone or just simply a notepad++ on computer, it depends if you're nerd guy sitting 12h at pc or just a guy that has to do many task outside pc so you use just your iphone.
use calendar and task management separated

I don't know what's your routine but if you have 1-2-3 activities you do sometime and you try to chain them like:
1. Cold Shower
2. Guided Meditation
3. Eat breakfast
4. Read news
5. Start your work/study
The first 3 or 4 activities chained together it's powerfully because it's like a flow. If you just do one is less powerful so 
Chaining habits it's life changing

You can't achieve things right?
There is a research that shows that if you have to read the book, don't think about reading but think about taking the book and opening, just that, and the brain will start to channel the flow as we talked before. You start reading the title, 5 words, maybe 10 pages till your brain gets a bit tired, go get some water, go to balcony watch something. In 5 minutes you'll be back ready to read.
If some things are hard, just start from 1st step, you can't do math exercises, start by reading few words and go on. Remember to reward yourself, I'll talk later.

Random Reward System
After some hard activities or long one, probably 1 hour or 45 minutes, you have to reward yourself, but reward is predictive, what if we use the gambling system but in productive way?
That's what I use Random Reward System, you choose a number of reward, it can be everything like eating chocolate, watching twitch/YouTube, or going 5minutes out or something not very pleasant but maybe funny. Once you have this n of activities you throw a dice, is better to have a physical system like a dice with 6 faces or 12 or however you want.
I assure you that the moment you have the reward you feel ascended, you don't feel tired anymore, but you can have variance, once you have n rewards and a reward is consumed, you have n - reward consumed so next time you have less rewards to be chosen not by you but random. 
What i use: i have 6 rewards because dice with 6 faces, after 30min focus pomodoro i just rest 5 min doing nothing, after 60min so 30+30 i use 1 reward by throwing a dice and go back, then the 2nd time so 90min is another reward, but if i have to lunch that was reset, so if after lunch I start 30min, i have maybe 5min rest, at 60min total i have random reward.

Using timers
This topic is hard one, I started using only timers the last few months for every task or commute I had to make, from going to gym to doing thesis or study. Instead of doing things at xx:xx hour you have to think like countdown, if you have to be wake up at 6am and is 11pm, you don't wake up at 6am but you wake up before 7 hours, so you start a timer with 7 hours to go. I know it has no sense but your brain start thinking in countdown mentality, if you have to take children at 2pm from school and is 1pm, it means you have less than 60 minutes. At first you use timer for 1 or 2 thing slowly you evolve to using it from waking up to going to bed to showering and cooking.

## Recording Thoughts - Actions - Finance
TAF or Thoughts, actions, finance.
The moment you start with one you have to finish recording all 3 of these main topics. This is huge topic and I hope to explain it well.
## Thoughts
Recording thoughts is vital because you record in whatever is best for you, typing at iphone, at your notebook paper. You just record or write at morning and before sleeping, I use daylio right now but I have to swap into another open source system to track my thoughts and my ahbits if daylio ends it.

## Actions
Record actions is similarly to habits, you have to divide it into categories like: 
#### productivity
waking up at 5,6,7,8? everyone has different cell or whatever system you use. university, learning a language
#### sleep
you slept well? bad? average? you define it mentally and then you pick 1,2,3. you went to bed before x? afer y? pick before or after. you define this too
#### food
did you ate at home? write home, or restaurant or a keyword that is standardized. if you ate meat or sweets, if you had soda or 24h fasting, 16h fasting or 12h fasting.
#### health
if you drank 2.5L water, or did you had a workout or did you smoke or drink alcohol (also drinks counts)
#### social
if you had family time, or relax time or friend time or met new people
#### free time
you learnt history, or watched a movie or went to theatre or vacation
#### Here my examples:

This is just some guidelines, you can adapt it to your needs, mine at start was very simple but I changed every year or 6 months
## Finance
I started from template to reddit at 2019 and now I use PowerBI automated where I export from my iphone to csv directly to folder where is read from PowerBI and tell me the insights. I worked on this for 2 months but was for my portfolio and because I enjoyed the process of learning. Sorry for flexing, for your case you start from excel, you just start having main categories and you update it every 6 month or what are you need but you have to have a finance tracker however you want it. 
This is my example just to show you some guidelines

This is from 5 years working at excel and switching to PowerBI (of course I'm becoming data analyst so this is just nothing)

## Write down your objectives
After we have 1 year of TAF recordings then we can start creating objectives simply using excel when you divide it into categories you choose but mainly are:
### Career
Everything that is into you career, or what's your dream's job or actual dream or both, is very flexible what to write on. For example if you want a certification or learn a new programming language if you're a software engineer
### Financial
Here you put numbers, whatever they are like 20% saving rate or 500 clothing budget or 1000 vacation or creating a fund emergence
### Spiritual
It can be meditation, yoga or whatever, personally I just have meditation right now
### Physical
This is gym, or body building or losing weight or gaining weight or going 10x gym (is read as going 10 times at gym)
### Intellectual/Education
This is very personal choice, not career side but your style, if you like philosophy, or history, or reading 2x books or whatever. This though has to be quantified e.g. "12 books" or "China's History"
### Family
This is very personal too, like helping parents, spending time with grandparents or uncle or aunts
### Social
Is kinda similar but different from Family, this you can put places to visit, like Japan, Europe or London or whatever or meet new people socialize whatever.

Clarification:
Every page of this has to be for 12 months, and 1 extra at beginning "objective year" when you write down what 2025 objectives will be. Here some examples
